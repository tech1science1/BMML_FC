# BMML_FC
# the code for a framework BMML_FC

# highly RECOMMEND to install SAM from https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git, and you can repalce it with advanced https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-body.githttps://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3.git

# Use /scripts/a1_SAMandCropping2.py to genrate masks and cropped images

# /asset contains data and SAM-generated masks (zero-shot)

# /scripts/a1_SAMandCropping2.py calculates the additional features, including the DPF features. Due to the shitty coding of 1st author, it takes time to proceed...

# /scripts/unet.py are used to trianed the DL models. RECOMMEND to get the code from https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet.git, https://github.com/sfczekalski/attention_unet.git, and https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/Swin-Unet.git 


# Files are being organized; more scripts will be updated soon....
